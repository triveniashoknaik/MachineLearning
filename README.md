A Study of Emotional Effect on an Authentication System based on EEG signals.
Implementing a system that would recognize the genuine and the imposter user depending on the users emotions using Machine Learning algorithms.
Used DEAP(A dataset for emotional Analysis using EEG, physiological and video signals)dataset to get all the responses in the form of emotions like arousal rate, valency rate of the user. 
Used tools like MATLAB for data processing and scripting language Python for getting results.
Used classifiers like k-NN , Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks for Analysis
Used Scikit learn libraries – sklearn , pandas, numpy.
